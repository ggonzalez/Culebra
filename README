CULEBRA: On-The-Cloud Programming Language with nifty security features

* Branch Features *
--------------------
- Added iterator AS keyword


* Security Features:
---------------------
1. Cross Cutting Security Hooks

- New file to configure cross cutting features. 
- Own syntax, maybe different from .cu files
- File containing checkings and external modules calls.
- Each execution point check whether it is subject to perform a security check.
- In the file, security checks can be hooked to ALL exec points or to a 
  given subset of them

TODO:
- Improve Behaviour variables
* Allow Behaviour vars nesting
- Add search over the whole Var history and over the database when DB Vars
* When datafilters are ready work to automatically fill new tables. Example: Asks for a new Client, when the variable ID is filled the data-hook is called and proceed to add a row to the Password table asking for it.
