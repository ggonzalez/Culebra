CULEBRA: On-The-Cloud Programming Language with nifty security features


* Security Features:
---------------------
1. Cross Cutting Security Hooks

- New file to configure cross cutting features. 
- Own syntax, maybe different from .cu files
- File containing checkings and external modules calls.
- Each execution point check whether it is subject to perform a security check.
- In the file, security checks can be hooked to ALL exec points or to a 
  given subset of them

* On-The-Cloud IPC
--------------------

- Instead of using the standard TCP/IP mechanisms to communicate two or more ends. Culebra is going to implent an on-the-cloud system.

TODO:
- Improve DB variables
