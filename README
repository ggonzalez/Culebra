CULEBRA: On-The-Cloud Programming Language with nifty security features

* Security Features:
---------------------
1. Cross Cutting Security Hooks

- Every function can specify hooks to other modules.functions, this way it is really simple to spread (cross-cut) any functionality the programmer needs to.
- Care about how data flows during run-time. Something like perl's taint mode but not as simple
